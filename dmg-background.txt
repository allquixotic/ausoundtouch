# DMG Background Design Specification
# This would be implemented as a 500x300 PNG image

Layout:
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) with subtle gradient
- Large arrow pointing from left to right in the center
- Text above the arrow: "Drag to install"
- Drop shadow effects on the arrow
- Optional: AUSoundTouch logo in top-left corner

The visual flow would be:
[AUSoundTouch.component] -----> [Components Folder]
       (left side)                  (right side)

This makes it immediately obvious what the user needs to do.
